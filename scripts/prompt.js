This is the JSON structure we are looking for. Ignore the content.

We are creating a similar character JSON for ${name} (@${username}). They've given us this information about them
${basicUserInfo}

The following are tweets from the user we are researching:
${chunk}

Given the following tweets, extract the following information:

1. A brief bio for ${name} (1 paragraph)
2. 5-10 interesting facts about ${name} (lore)
3. 3-5 adjectives that describe ${name}'s posts
4. 3-5 specific topics ${name} is interested in
5. 3-5 stylistic directions for how ${name} speaks which are very specific to this user's writing style
6. 3-5 stylistic directions for how ${name} chats in DMs or back-and-forth conversations, again only capturing the specific nuances of this user's writing style
7. 3-5 stylistic directions for how ${name} writes posts (post), specific to how the user writes and formats posts and presents information

BIO
The bio should be very specific to ${name}. Who they are, what they like and dislike, where they live or are from, what they care about, what they do for a living, relationship status, everything. Be as detailed as possible in building a profile of them. The bio should include elements extracted from the text and should be extremely specific.

LORE
Lore should be true facts about ${name} (@${username}). They should be things that the user has stated about themselves or revealed in a confident tone indicating their veracity, and that are always true. If ${name} went skiing, for example, that isn't relevant. But if ${name} saved someone's life while skiing, that's great lore and should be recorded. Be very specific, and capture anything that is unique to this user and their life story.

ADJECTIVES
Adjectives should be specific and unique to ${name}. They should be so unique that you could pick out ${name} just from their adjectives. Use very specific, clear adjectives. Don't use broad, non-specific or overused adjecties. These should be unique descriptions of ${name}

TOPICS
Topics should be specific and unique to ${name}. Ignore any other users and just extract the topics from ${name}'s writing. Very niche topics are good. Broad topics are bad. These should be topics the user is unequivocally interested in, even if they are one of a few people in the world who cares.

STYLE
Examine the style of ${name}'s writing and write an array of style directions, instructions on how to re-create the specific nuances of how the user writes.
Ignore the writing or any other usrs. We are only interested in the style of ${name} (@${username}).

MESSAGE EXAMPLES
Examples of messages back and forth with imaginary users our user interacts with. Should capture their writing style, interests and essence.

POST EXAMPLES
Examples of posts which ${name} (@${username}) has written. DO NOT include any text from any other users. This should capture their style, essence and interests. If they use emojis or hashtags, use emojis or hashtags, otherwise don't use them.

IMPORTANT: Only capture the information for ${name} (${username}). Don't capture the information for any other users, or any users ${name} is talking to.
Avoid specific biased domains, for example politics, religion, or other broadly divisive topics.

Respond with a JSON object containing the extracted information. Wrap the JSON in a markdown code block. Here's an example of the expected output format:
